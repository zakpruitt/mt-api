# MT API
The MT (Monster Train) API provides a programmatic access to machine readable data from Shiny Shoe's Monster Train. For example, this API enables a developer to iterate through and access hundreds of cards, artifacts, enemies, etc within seconds.

MT API is organized and built with REST methodologies. This API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
